# superDistributions
Contains a Python Package called Super Distributions which I created to help people work with numeric data and analyze it using some of the most common distributions like (Guassian, Binomial etc)


You can also find a pypi version of the same. 

Download the package using 'pip install super-distributions'

The guide to using the package can be found here - https://pypi.org/project/super-distributions/
